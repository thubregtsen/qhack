    """Find the maximum independent set of an input graph given some optimized QAOA parameters.

    The code you write for this challenge should be completely contained within this function
    between the # QHACK # comment markers. You should create a device, set up the QAOA ansatz circuit
    and measure the probabilities of that circuit using the given optimized parameters. Your next
    step will be to analyze the probabilities and determine the maximum independent set of the
    graph. Return the maximum independent set as an ordered list of nodes.

    Args:
        graph (nx.Graph): A NetworkX graph
        params (np.ndarray): Optimized QAOA parameters of shape (2, 10)
